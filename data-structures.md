## Arrays

* Data type specifically to store sequences of values.
* first index of an array is zero, not one.

The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets. 
When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property. When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name.
